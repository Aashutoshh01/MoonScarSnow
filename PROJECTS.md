# 💻 Projects

Here is a collection of my key projects spanning AI Agents, Large Language Models (LLMs), Computer Vision, and Quantitative Finance.

## 🤖 AI Agents & Systems

### [Agentorithm](https://github.com/Aashutoshh01/Agentorithm)
**Multi-Agent DSA Solver**
A sophisticated, multi-agent AI system designed to solve Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems. It leverages multiple agents to break down complex problems and generate optimal solutions.

### [CerinaFoundry](https://github.com/Aashutoshh01/CerinaFoundry)
**Mental Health Protocol Assistant**
A specialized multi-agent AI system designed to assist mental health professionals in drafting Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) clinical protocols.

### [StockSage](https://github.com/Aashutoshh01/StockSage)
**Financial Analysis Agent**
A powerful, multi-agent financial analysis tool built with the phidata library, capable of performing deep dives into stock market data.

## 🧠 LLMs & NLP

### [Indic-ASR](https://github.com/Aashutoshh01/Indic-ASR)
**SOTA Hindi Speech Recognition**
Reduced Word Error Rate (WER) from 30.18% to 20.75%, matching performance of AI4Bharat's specialized Bhashini model and bridging the gap to commercial APIs like Sarvam.

### [LlamaCare](https://github.com/Aashutoshh01/LlamaCare)
**Empathetic Mental Health LLM**
A LoRA-fine-tuned TinyLlama-1.1B model designed for supportive, empathetic mental-health responses. Trained on a custom 15k-sample dataset with 4-bit quantization.

### [ScratchSpeakSLM](https://github.com/Aashutoshh01/ScratchSpeakSLM)
**SLM from Scratch**
A tiny GPT-style language model built completely from scratch in PyTorch, inspired by TinyStories, demonstrating how small transformer models can learn to generate coherent text.

### [ArXivGPT](https://github.com/Aashutoshh01/ArXivGPT)
**Scientific Paper Generator**
A 124M-parameter GPT-2 model trained from scratch on ArXiv abstracts, featuring fully custom Transformer components implemented in PyTorch.

### [CFAspire](https://github.com/Aashutoshh01/CFAspire)
**Exam Prep Chatbot**
An intelligent chatbot designed to help users study for the CFA Level 1 exam.
