## 📌 About Me

🌱 **I learn and build across advanced AI/ML systems.**
My work spans transformer architectures, small language models (SLMs), and complex-valued deep learning.

🤝 **Open Source & Research**
I actively collaborate on open-source AI projects, research prototypes, and high-performance model training pipelines.

🔍 **Scalable Systems**
I work on scalable agentic AI systems, distributed training setups, and multimodal model design.

🚀 **From Scratch to Scale**
I build models from scratch (GPT-style LLMs, ViTs), design full training/evaluation workflows, and deploy interactive UIs.

🧠 **Research Focus**
I research SAR processing, complex-valued neural networks, and efficient adaptation methods such as LoRA and CV-LoRA.
