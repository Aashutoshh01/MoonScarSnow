# 🔬 Research

My research interests lie at the intersection of complex-valued deep learning, multimodal systems, and efficient model architecture.

## 📚 Selected Works & Implementations

### [Complex-Valued Transformer](https://github.com/Aashutoshh01/complex-valued-transformer)
Implementation of the transformer proposed in "Building Blocks for a Complex-Valued Transformer Architecture". This project explores the utility of complex numbers in neural network representations for capturing phase information and wave-like patterns.

### [Pytorch Paligemma](https://github.com/Aashutoshh01/pytorch-paligemma)
**Multimodal Vision-Language Model**
Coding a Multimodal (Vision) Language Model from scratch in PyTorch with full explanation. This project serves as a deep dive into the architecture of modern VLM systems.

### [Research Notebooks](https://github.com/Aashutoshh01/Research)
Open sourced research notebooks covering various experiments in quantitative finance and machine learning strategies.
