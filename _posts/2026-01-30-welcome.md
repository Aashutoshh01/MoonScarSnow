Welcome to my new portfolio website! 

I built this site to showcase my work in **AI Research**, **LLMs**, and **Complex Systems**. 

### What you'll find here:

1.  **Projects**: A comprehensive list of my open-source contributions and personal projects.
2.  **Research**: My explorations into Complex-Valued Neural Networks and other advanced topics.
3.  **Blog**: Thoughts, tutorials, and updates on my latest experiments.

Stay tuned for more updates!
